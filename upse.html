  <h1>About UPSC</h1>
  <p class="description-text" id="upscDescription">
    The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is India's premier central recruiting agency responsible for conducting examinations for appointments to the various civil services of the Government of India. Established on October 1, 1926, UPSC plays a vital role in recruiting top-notch professionals to serve in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), and many other Group A and Group B services. The UPSC examination is one of the toughest and most prestigious exams in India, testing candidates on a wide range of subjects, including history, geography, polity, economics, environment, and ethics.<br><br>
    The selection process is rigorous, consisting of three stages: Preliminary Examination, Main Examination, and Personality Test (Interview). The Preliminary exam filters candidates for the Main exam, which requires writing detailed answers to a variety of questions, testing analytical abilities, knowledge, and articulation skills. The final interview assesses the candidate's personality, suitability for public service, and decision-making capabilities.<br><br>
    Candidates preparing for UPSC must have a thorough understanding of multiple subjects and current affairs, combined with strong writing and analytical skills. The exam demands consistency, dedication, and a strategic approach. Many aspirants use standard textbooks, daily newspapers, government reports, and coaching material to prepare.<br><br>
    UPSC officers are expected to maintain high ethical standards, serve with integrity, and uphold the Constitution of India. The selection by UPSC is a gateway to serving the nation and contributing to its governance, development, and policy-making.
