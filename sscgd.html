      answer: "Morning",
      explanation: "Morning workouts help the body adapt to cooler conditions similar to test timings."
    },
    {
      question: "How many weeks of preparation are ideally recommended for PET?",
      answer: "At least 4 weeks",
      explanation: "A minimum of 4 weeks of focused practice improves stamina and timing for PET."
    },
    {
      question: "Which nutrient is most important for muscle recovery during training?",
      answer: "Protein",
      explanation: "Protein helps repair and build muscles after physical workouts."

  questions: [
    {
      question: "How should you start training for the 5 km race if you are a beginner?",
      answer: "Start with 2 km slow running for the first week.",
      explanation: "If you are new, running 5 km from day one can cause fatigue and injury. Start with 2 km at an easy pace, increase distance by 500m every 3 days until you reach 5 km."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the correct running posture for maximum efficiency?",
      answer: "Slight forward lean, relaxed shoulders, and steady breathing.",
      explanation: "Leaning slightly forward uses gravity to propel you, relaxed shoulders prevent stiffness, and steady breathing improves oxygen supply to muscles."
    },
    {
      question: "What warm-up routine should you do before PET practice?",
      answer: "10 minutes of dynamic stretching followed by 5 minutes of light jogging.",
      explanation: "Dynamic stretches like leg swings and arm circles prepare your muscles, while light jogging increases blood flow and reduces injury risk."
    },
    {
      question: "How can you improve your running speed in the last 500 meters?",
      answer: "Use sprint intervals during training.",
      explanation: "Practicing short bursts of high speed in the last part of your run trains your body to push harder at the finish."
    },
    {
      question: "What breathing technique is best for long-distance running?",
      answer: "Inhale through the nose for 3 steps, exhale through the mouth for 2 steps.",
      explanation: "This technique ensures rhythmic breathing, better oxygen intake, and less fatigue."
    },
    {
      question: "How many days per week should you practice for PET?",
      answer: "5 days a week with 2 days rest.",
      explanation: "Running every day without rest leads to overtraining. Rest days help muscles recover and grow stronger."
    },
    {
      question: "What type of diet supports PET preparation?",
      answer: "High-protein, balanced carbs, and hydration.",
      explanation: "Protein repairs muscles, carbs provide energy, and water keeps you hydrated for endurance."
    },
    {
      question: "How should you pace yourself in the 5 km race?",
      answer: "Run the first 3 km at a comfortable pace, then increase speed gradually.",
      explanation: "Starting too fast can cause early fatigue. A steady pace keeps energy for the final sprint."
    },
    {
      question: "What mental strategy helps during long runs?",
      answer: "Break the run into small segments in your mind.",
      explanation: "Instead of thinking about 5 km at once, focus on reaching the next 500m. This makes the distance feel shorter."
    },
    {
      question: "How to practice for 1.6 km race for females?",
      answer: "Alternate between slow jogging and short sprints for 20 minutes daily.",
      explanation: "This improves both endurance and speed, helping you complete 1.6 km in the required 8.5 minutes."

    {
      question: "What is the minimum height requirement for male candidates in SSC GD?",
      answer: "170 cm for general category (relaxation for certain categories).",
      explanation: "Male candidates must be at least 170 cm tall (except for specified relaxation for ST and other categories as per SSC rules)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minimum height requirement for female candidates in SSC GD?",
      answer: "157 cm for general category.",
      explanation: "Female candidates must be at least 157 cm tall, with relaxations for some categories."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the required chest measurement for male candidates?",
      answer: "Unexpanded: 80 cm; Expanded: 85 cm.",
      explanation: "Male candidates should have at least 5 cm expansion between normal and expanded chest measurements."
    },
    {
      question: "What eyesight standard is required for SSC GD?",
      answer: "6/6 and 6/9 vision without glasses.",
      explanation: "Candidates must have near-perfect vision without corrective lenses. Wearing spectacles during the test will not be allowed."
    },
    {
      question: "How can candidates prepare for the vision test?",
      answer: "Limit screen time, eat vitamin A-rich foods, and do eye exercises.",
      explanation: "Carrots, spinach, and regular eye rest improve vision; avoiding excessive screen time helps reduce strain."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the hearing ability requirement?",
      answer: "Normal hearing without aids.",
      explanation: "You must be able to hear whispered words at a distance of 6 meters in one ear and 3 meters in the other."
    },
    {
      question: "How can you prepare for the chest expansion test?",
      answer: "Practice deep breathing exercises daily.",
      explanation: "Exercises like pranayama and deep inhales strengthen lung capacity, improving chest expansion."
    },
    {
      question: "What should you avoid before the medical test?",
      answer: "Heavy workout, oily food, and late-night sleep.",
      explanation: "These can cause fatigue, dehydration, and eye redness, which might affect results."
    },
    {
      question: "How to maintain overall fitness for the medical test?",
      answer: "Balanced diet, daily exercise, and adequate rest.",
      explanation: "A mix of cardio, strength, and stretching keeps the body in peak condition for all checks."
    },
    {
      question: "What to do if you have a minor medical issue before the test?",
      answer: "Consult a doctor and get treatment in advance.",
      explanation: "Even minor issues like ear wax or conjunctivitis can lead to temporary disqualification if not treated before the test."
